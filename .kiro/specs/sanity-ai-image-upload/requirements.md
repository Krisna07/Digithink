# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will enable the system to properly upload AI-generated images directly to Sanity CMS instead of saving them to the local file system. The current implementation has type mismatches and doesn't properly handle Buffer-to-File conversion for Sanity uploads.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want AI-generated images to be uploaded directly to Sanity CMS, so that all blog images are centrally managed and accessible through the CMS.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an AI image is generated THEN the system SHALL convert the Buffer to a proper format for Sanity upload
2. WHEN the image upload is successful THEN the system SHALL return the Sanity asset reference ID
3. WHEN the image upload fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messaging
4. IF the image generation produces multiple images THEN the system SHALL upload each image individually to Sanity

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want generated blog posts to automatically include the AI-generated images, so that the blog content is complete without manual image uploads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a blog post is generated with AI THEN the system SHALL automatically generate and upload a relevant image
2. WHEN the image upload is complete THEN the system SHALL associate the image with the blog post
3. WHEN the blog post is saved THEN the system SHALL include the Sanity image reference in the post data
4. IF image generation fails THEN the system SHALL allow the blog post to be created without an image

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper error handling for image uploads, so that failures don't break the blog creation process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image upload fails THEN the system SHALL log the error details
2. WHEN an upload fails THEN the system SHALL continue with blog post creation
3. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL retry the upload up to 3 times
4. IF all retries fail THEN the system SHALL notify the user of the upload failure

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the image upload function to handle different image formats, so that the system works with various AI-generated image types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image is generated THEN the system SHALL detect the MIME type correctly
2. WHEN uploading to Sanity THEN the system SHALL preserve the original image format
3. WHEN the image format is unsupported THEN the system SHALL convert to a supported format
4. IF format conversion fails THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error messaging
